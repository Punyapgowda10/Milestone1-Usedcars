    "There is an automobile company XYZ from USA which aspires to enter the US used car market by setting up their company locally to give competition to their counterparts. They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the market, since those may be vastly different from the new car market.\n",
    "       \n",
    "The market for used cars has witnessed a significant surge in demand in recent times, surpassing that of new cars. Consequently, pricing strategies for used vehicles have become crucial for businesses to remain competitive in the market. The value of a used car is influenced by a multitude of factors, such as mileage, model, and year of production. It is imperative for industry players to consider these variables while determining the actual worth of a used car.\n",

Based on your findings, the next level of analysis will be charted out. Build a multiple linear regression model for predicting the price of a used car and provide meaningful inferences.\n"
